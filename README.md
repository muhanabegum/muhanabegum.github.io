Check out my personal web portfolio. This is a personal design and colour scheme that I brainstormed of and used Bootstrap to help make it responsive.

A personal website has been a goal of mine for a while now and I'm proud to say that I have finally accomplished it. 
You can check out my web portfolio by visiting www.muhanabegum.me ! (or copy muhanabegum.github.io into your browser). 

For the design of my website, I took a great interest into the concept of neumorphism and decided to try it out. Below are the images of the different sections of my website. 

The first section is the main page where I tried to keep it as simple and clean as possible.

Contrary to typical neumorphism design, I decided to switch things up with the colours so there was some variety.

The final section includes all my projects. For more of my projects, check out my other repositories!
